to allow users to search for their next holiday destination. 

The finished webpage should allow users to search for: 
- destination cities/countries

## Features

## Testing
In this section, 
- add user stories and
- examples of testing carried out

## Deployment
- mockups of the site layout were made using Paintbrush (copies can be found in the wireframes folder.)
- From this the basic layout of the webpage was coded in Cloud9.
- Following this, additional coding was added, including the API's needed to display the Google maps.
- During this process, repeated contact was made with my Tutor to help with ideas and coding, and tokeep the project on track.
- At various stages during the coding on Cloud9, th ecode was copied/pushed to Github. 
- Finally, upon finishing the project 'went live' through Github via Github Pages.
